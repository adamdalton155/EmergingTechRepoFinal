    "QisKit, described by the IBM, the makers, is an open source SDK for working with quantim computers at the level of pulses, circuts and application modules. There are two ways you can get started with QisKit. The first being locally and the other is hosting it Jupyter Notebooks. It is worth mentioning that IBM says running QisKit locally is more secure and private. Running QisKit locally requires Python 3.7 (released June 27th 2018) or higher. From the Terminal or Command Prompt, just run the command 'pip install qiskit' and all the requirments will be installed.\n",

    "QisKit includes a vast set of quantum gates and pre-built circuts so users of any level can use QisKit in their own research and development of their applications. Users can run and schdule jobs on quantum processors and employ QisKit runtime to orchestrate programs on cloud-based Central Processing Units(CPUs), Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). By IBM devloping QisKit and these features, IBM/QisKit have managed to unify three different levels of users\n",
