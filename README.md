<H1>ReadMe for my Emerging Technologies repository!</h1>
<h4>Within this repository there are five Jupyter Notebooks. Each one covers a set topic and then goes into detail on sub topics relating to the main topic. Here is a breakdown of what is covered in each notebook</h4>
<ul>
<li>
  <p> Topic One: HTTP <br>
   In this notebook, there is an overview of HTTP, explaining what it is and when it was made. Then we discuss the structure of a HTTP Request and Response and show images of what they look like. The next section I go over the advantages and disadvantages 
of Static and Hybrid webpages, discuss Hugo and GitHub actions and the structure of YAML. Finally explain Web servers and what they do</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> Topic Two: Project Jupyter <br>
  For Topic Two, we discuss the history of Project Jupyter and all of it's iterations and we look at some great python packages we can install to use on the platform and what they do.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p> Topic Three: Computation <br>
  In Topic Three, we look at what a computational problem is. After, we discuss multiplying matrices and the different algorithms (Strassens Algorithm/Matrix Multiplication Algorithm) to do so. We then delve into time complexities for algorithms, how they are measured (Polynomial and Exponential) and how Big O Notation relates to these. Finally in this notebook we look at the Turing machine along with a Python implementation and how it uses logic gates and how they're combined.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> Topic Three: Fourier Transform  <br>
  For Topic Four, we learn about the Fourier Transform and what it is, the different theorms (Shifting, Inversion and Convolution) and their formulas. Also included is some python implementations for Fourier Transform
  </p>
</li>

</ul>
